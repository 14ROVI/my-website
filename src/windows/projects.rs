                A Discord Bot which I spent multiple years developing.
                Featuring it's own programming language, reminders, ranking, image manipulation and generation, YouTube and Twitch integrations, it was my biggest project.
                It was mainly coded in python but for it's website I used JS, HTML, and CSS (NO FRAMEWORKS, in fact I made my own mini router for this).
                It had a Postgres database which the website and bot interacted with via a RPC interface I coded with custom caching.
                My one truly full stack project.

                Kit was my entry into the 2022 CSS GameJam. Although it didn't win any prizes I learnt a lot about Rust and ECS game development in the process.
                Either way it is a fun little proof of concept that you can make quick and simple platformer games using Rust.

                In the past I ran a Discord bot called Luna and people would ask me to implement lots of random features. Of course, this is not theasable
                and would break up my code base a ton for rarely used code. So, I learnt how to make programming languages and created my own so people
                can use that to add their own code which would be executed. I needed to do this instead of restricted environments because they still have
                vulnerabilities (especially in Python) and It meant I could limit API calls and such easier.
